Build a lightweight inference logging and ingestion system for an LLM application.

## **1\. Chatbot Application**

Build a simple chatbot using any foundation model API.

Examples:

* GPT-4.1  
* Claude Sonnet  
* Gemini  
* DeepSeek  
* Grok  
* any equivalent model

The chatbot should:

* support multi-turn conversations  
* maintain short conversational context  
* expose a simple UI

---

## **2\. Lightweight SDK / Wrapper**

Create a lightweight SDK, middleware, or wrapper around your LLM calls that captures inference metadata.

Examples of metadata:

* model  
* provider  
* latency  
* token usage  
* timestamps  
* request status/errors  
* conversation/session ID  
* input/output previews

The SDK should send logs to an ingestion endpoint in near real time. Implementation details are flexible.

---

## **3\. Ingestion Pipeline**

Build an ingestion service/API that:

* receives logs from the SDK  
* validates/parses payloads  
* extracts useful metadata  
* stores processed data in a database

---

## **4\. Database Storage**

Store:

* chat messages  
* inference logs  
* extracted metadata

We care about sensible schema design and practical tradeoffs.

Complete source code.

## **2\. README**

Include:

* setup instructions  
* architecture overview  
* schema design decisions  
* tradeoffs made  
* what you would improve with more time

## **3\. Architecture Notes**

Briefly explain:

* ingestion flow  
* logging strategy  
* scaling considerations  
* failure handling assumptions

## **4\. Demo**

Hosted link, screenshots, or Loom video.

# **Bonus** 

**You will be given a guaranteed interview if you are able to complete the following task.**

* **Multi-provider support**  
* **Streaming Responses**  
* **Latency \+ Throughput \+ Errors dashboards**  
* **Docker Compose one-command setup**  
* **Event based architecture**  
* PII redaction  
* Deploy application on self hosted k8s

**Frontend**

**The UI allows following:**

1. Cancel a conversation  
2. List conversations  
3. Resume a conversation
